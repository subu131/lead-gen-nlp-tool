I decided to once again use Heightsafe Systems due to my previous dealings with the company and would again have no hesitation in employing them for future works. Once again they were efficient with a professional approach to HS which is critical in our line of work. The quality of work that was provided at a competitive cost was second to none the communication RAMS and Operatives on site were a credit to themselves.   We use Heightsafe Systems as they have a good reputation for all working at height requirements.

Heightsafe were professional attentive to client needs friendly when onsite and conducted themselves extremely well. The works carried out where to our time scales and the quality of work was good. The  things I would conclude from the install is that they were professional provided a friendly service from start to finish and good workmanship when onsite. I would recommend HSS to any of my contractors.   This year I have been very pleased with the service we have received from Heightsafe Systems Its been very useful to combine services much as the safety line testing and lightning conductor testing at our sites at Llangefni and Conwy.

I have found the staff very easy to communicate with. I have had no issues with your Engineers and have found them all to be very helpful when onsite. Out of all the contractors we have at our five sites in the UK I would put Heightsafe first when it comes to RAMS Whenever I have requested RAMS you have delivered them. This is really helpful as it doesnt hold up works this is not the case with many of our other contractors believe me   We are very happy with the new Safety Line system that has been installed at one of The Trade Centres new showrooms. Heightsafes professionalism paired with their quick responses services and friendly staff are just what you will need. Additional information was also provided throughout the process allowing for my own knowledge to grow.
